# Quick Fix Summary - MinIO Data Sync Issue

## Problem
When creating a new "centar", data wasn't syncing properly with MinIO because file uploads happened separately from center creation.

## Solution
Modified the system to upload files (images/PDFs) to MinIO **during** center creation, not after.

## What Changed

### 1. Backend (Java) - `CentarKontroler.java`
- ✅ Changed `/novicentar` endpoint to accept file uploads
- ✅ Files now upload to MinIO immediately when creating a center
- ✅ Elasticsearch indexes complete data (including file paths) in one operation
- ✅ Added proper logging with `@Slf4j`

### 2. Frontend (Angular) - `novi-centar.component.ts`
- ✅ Changed from JSON to FormData multipart request
- ✅ Single API call now creates center AND uploads files
- ✅ Removed two-step process (create → upload)
- ✅ Better user experience with immediate feedback

## How to Test

1. Start backend:
   ```powershell
   cd backend
   .\docker-manage.ps1 -action start
   ```

2. Start frontend:
   ```powershell
   cd KVT
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

3. Create a new centar with image/PDF files and verify:
   - Files appear in MinIO (http://localhost:9001)
   - Data is immediately searchable
   - No delay between creation and file availability

## Key Benefits
✅ Atomic operations - all data created at once  
✅ Better data consistency  
✅ Improved performance  
✅ Simplified error handling  
✅ Files available immediately after creation  

## Files Modified
- `backend/projekt/src/main/java/com/example/sss/kontroleri/CentarKontroler.java`
- `KVT/src/app/novi-centar/novi-centar.component.ts`

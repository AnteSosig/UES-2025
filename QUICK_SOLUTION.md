# 🎯 THE REAL PROBLEM - SOLVED!

## What Was Actually Wrong

```
❌ Your files were TOO LARGE (over 10MB)
❌ Backend rejected them silently
❌ Frontend showed unhelpful "0 Unknown Error"
```

## The Fix

```
✅ Increased file size limit: 10MB → 50MB
✅ Added clear error messages
✅ Added better CORS handling
✅ Backend restarted with new config
```

## Test Now

**Before uploading, check your file size:**

```powershell
Get-Item "C:\path\to\your\file.jpg" | Select-Object Name, @{Name="SizeMB";Expression={[math]::Round($_.Length/1MB,2)}}
```

**If under 50MB → Should work! ✅**
**If over 50MB → Compress it or tell me to increase limit**

## Quick Test

1. Go to http://localhost:4200
2. Login as admin
3. Create/edit centar
4. Upload files **under 50MB**
5. Should work now! 🎉

## Need Bigger Limit?

If you need to upload files over 50MB, just say so and I'll increase it to 100MB, 200MB, or whatever you need.

**Backend is running with 50MB limit. Test it now!**
